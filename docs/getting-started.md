# Getting started on Windows

## Requirements

- Windows 10 1809 or newer, x64 or ARM64.
- .NET 8 SDK or newer.
- Visual Studio 2022 or newer with .NET desktop development and Windows Application
  Packaging Project tools for packaged debugging and the package designer.
- Windows SDK with MakeAppx and SignTool for command-line MSIX packaging/signing.

The backend is C#. Rust, Cargo, MSVC, Python, Node.js and npm are not needed to
build or run the application. Python is used only by CI policy tests.

## Visual Studio

Open `Reminders.Windows.sln`. Select x64 or ARM64 and set `Reminders.Package` as
the startup project. Its project reference builds and publishes `Reminders.WinUI`
with `Reminders.Core` included. The checked-in `Package.appxmanifest` supports the
manifest designer and **Publish → Create App Packages** workflow.

Configure a signing certificate in the package project before deploying with F5.
Use a certificate whose subject matches the manifest publisher. Trust a development
certificate on your test device as appropriate. No private signing key is committed.
Unsigned packages can be built for inspection but cannot be installed.

For unpackaged debugging, set `Reminders.WinUI` as the startup project. The
`Reminders.Core.Tests` and `AppUpdater.Tests` console projects can run separately.

## Demo and development launches

```powershell
.\scripts\run-windows.ps1 -Demo
.\scripts\run-windows.ps1
```

Demo mode displays sample data without opening the real cache, reading credentials,
or contacting iCloud. Debug builds accept `REMINDERS_DATA_DIR` for a separate test
cache directory. Release builds use the normal LocalAppData location. There is no
executable override or sidecar process.

## MSIX distribution

For public distribution without asking users to trust a development certificate,
use the [Microsoft Store submission workflow](microsoft-store.md). Microsoft signs
the approved app; `build-msix.ps1 -Store` prepares packages using your assigned
Partner Center identity and writes them to `dist-store`.

```powershell
.\scripts\check-prereqs.ps1 -Msix
.\scripts\build-msix.ps1 -Architecture x64
.\scripts\build-msix.ps1 -Architecture ARM64
```

The script publishes the self-contained application and packages it using the
same manifest and logos as Visual Studio. Outputs are
`dist-msix\Reminders-for-Windows-x64.msix` and
`dist-msix\Reminders-for-Windows-ARM64.msix`. `-SkipBuild` packages an existing
portable publish directory.

```powershell
.\scripts\build-msix.ps1 -Architecture x64 -CertificateThumbprint YOUR_THUMBPRINT
Add-AppxPackage .\dist-msix\Reminders-for-Windows-x64.msix
```

Signing uses `Cert:\CurrentUser\My` and automatically adopts the certificate subject
as Publisher. `-IdentityName` and `-Publisher` support an assigned Store identity
for unsigned artifacts. Keep identity/publisher stable and raise both the WinUI
`<Version>` and manifest Identity Version (four components) when shipping updates.
Windows package deployment handles MSIX upgrades; the app does not run an Inno
installer from an MSIX installation.

Windows applies package data virtualization: installing MSIX does not automatically
import an unpackaged app's LocalAppData. Verify migration on a test account before
replacing a production installation. Credential Manager target names remain stable.

## Portable and existing installer builds

```powershell
.\scripts\build-windows.ps1 -Architecture x64
.\dist-windows\Reminders.exe
.\scripts\build-installer.ps1 -Architecture x64
```

Keep the publish folder together; it contains the WinUI and .NET runtimes, SQLite
native library, resources and `Reminders.Core.dll`. ARM64 output is under
`dist-windows-arm64`. The Inno installer supports existing installations/updaters.

## Verification and troubleshooting

```powershell
dotnet run --project .\src-windows\Reminders.Core.Tests\Reminders.Core.Tests.csproj -c Release
dotnet run --project .\src-windows\AppUpdater.Tests\AppUpdater.Tests.csproj -c Release
dotnet build .\src-windows\Reminders.WinUI\Reminders.WinUI.csproj -c Release -p:Platform=x64
```

Choose **Text me a code** and enter the latest texted code for two-factor sign-in.
Device-prompt codes cannot complete Apple's HSA2 bridge in this app. Accounts need
a trusted phone number. Cached reminders remain available during outages; upload
errors leave edits queued and conflicts ask which version to keep. **Sync now**
retrieves changes from Apple devices; the normal automatic interval is ten minutes.

Unpackaged logs are under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\RemindersSync\logs\app.log`; packaged
installations may have a virtualized location. Include the app version and relevant
error when reporting issues. Review logs before sharing them.
